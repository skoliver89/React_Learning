### Boilerplate Cloned From [https://github.com/hendrikswan/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/hendrikswan/react-boilerplate)

All work in this github branch follows along with the course mentioned below and is not owned by myself.

Therefore, all licensing shall be retained from the originating authors. 


### This is a fork from https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate. 

It's only purpose is to make it easier for people to follow along with my "Scaling React Apps" course on pluralsight.com: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-boilerplate-building-scalable-apps. 

By working from this fork, you are guaranteed that you will get exactly the same versions that I used when I built the course. I also made 1 tiny change in the boilerplate to make the course easier to follow along. This is mentioned in the course, but it is important enough to mention here too. 

This is not my boilerplate! **It's just a fork with a few tweaks for the course.**
